# Wind-Turbine-O-M-Strategy-Documents
This is a collection of Wind Turbine Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) strategy documents accumulated from a variety of online resources. The resources including white papers, research articles (long and short) and other similar elements.
As an ongoing project, we hope that this repository may prove useful to engineers, technicians, researchers and other academics for a better understanding of how corrective maintenance operations
can be used to fix a possible degradation of turbine sub-components optimally.

All documents are copyright of their respective owners, and the authors of this repository are not responsible for any factual inaccuracy or 
problems in the documents. If you would like to contribute to this project by suggesting more publically available documents, feel free to create a Pull Request.

All documents are sourced from publically available documents in the World Wide Web, and below, we have cited the documents used
for information. We aim to expand the repository to have hundreds of such documents in a single platform.
